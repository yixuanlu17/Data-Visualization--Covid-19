# ðŸš€Data-Visuliaztion-Covid 19ðŸš€
I believe data can tell a good story! A good visualization should establish two aspects of the data being presented: Show connections within the data that are too complex to explain with words. Make it easier for the audience to quickly understand the information presented and consider the outcomes from that data.

## Dataset Information 
This dataset is from Github Real-time data. 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv

However, since I was working on this project until March 2020, the time shown in this project was until March 2020.
